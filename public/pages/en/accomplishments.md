**3rd Place Winner** @ [AeonX Code Clash Hackathon 2024](https://www.aeonx.digital/) _(Aug 2024)_

- Developed Doculens AI, an intelligent document management app that collects documents via mailbox, WhatsApp, or upload. Using a custom OCR AI model, the app extracts and categorizes data into over 200 document types and subcategories (e.g., government documents like PAN Card, Aadhaar Card, Resumes, invoices). Leveraging web sockets for real-time updates, we created a smooth user experience. Doculens AI can integrate directly with organizations for use cases like HR onboarding and expense management, providing deep data extraction for further processing.
